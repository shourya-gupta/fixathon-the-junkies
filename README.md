## Description:

**Waste management:**

**Title: The Junkies
“Don’t waste your waste”**

A lot of recyclable and reusable household dry waste is simply
dumped into the junkyards without realising the worth of the waste products. A
simple glass bottle is often thrown away in the dustbin when you can actually earn
quite a lot of pennies by selling it off directly to recycling centres and contribute to
waste management at the same time without the need of any middlemen.

## Features



A smart waste management system which :
- Predicts the prices of the waste at user’s end so that they can get the best prices according to the waste they collected without the need to any middlemen.

- Will directly connect users to recycling centres by giving the suggestions of nearby recycling centres.
